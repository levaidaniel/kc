2.3.0:

Bug fixes:
- Plug in some memory leaks.

Improvements:
- New command 'status':
	What database file is in use...
	...and other funny stuff about the current database.
- New command 'info':
	Displays information about a key (currently only
	'created' and 'modified' properties).
- Make it possible to compile kc with libedit on Linux too, with the EDITLINE
  flag. The default remains readline on Linux.

Cosmetic changes:
- Add PCRE information to version.
