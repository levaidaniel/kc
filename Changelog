2.2.0:

Bug fixes:
- Plug a potential memory leak in cmd_new.c (the xmlFree() got stuck in an #ifndef):
  When using the readline functions, and the readline()
  call failed (couldn't read a line due to some error),
  then when returning from cmd_new(), the already read
  'key' would not have been freed.

Improvements:
- Introduce a new command 'passwd' that can be used to change the current database's password.
- New passwords are asked twice for confirmation.
- add an alias for 'clist': 'cls'
- Introduce a new utility, which can (hopefully) convert pwsafe databases to kc XML databases.
- man page and documentation updates
- new feature to the 'new' and 'edit' commands:
  Now the escape sequences \r, \R, \a, \A can be used
  to request random characters in the value input. (sort
  of like \n to request a new line)
- New functional tests for detecting regressions.
- 'del' will ask for confirmation just like 'cdel'

Cosmetic changes:
- clean up unused variables
- sort the commands (quasi) by their names
