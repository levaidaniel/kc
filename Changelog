2.2.2:
Bug fixes:
- Don't allow to import an empty or corrupt database (this also makes the
  importing less flexible about "bad" kc XML files, but without validation
  (it's in v2.3), this is all we can do now). Before this change this would
  result in a segfault.
- Fix editline TAB completion, so that partial commands will be completed up
  until the first differing character in the matched command names.
- Fix keychain name comparison during keychain delete.

2.2.1:
Bug fixes:
- Plug in memory leaks
- Don't link to libssl, just libcrypto

2.2.0:

Bug fixes:
- Plug a potential memory leak in cmd_new.c (the xmlFree() got stuck in an #ifndef):
  When using the readline functions, and the readline()
  call failed (couldn't read a line due to some error),
  then when returning from cmd_new(), the already read
  'key' would not have been freed.
- Fix multiline value displaying when directly jumping to a specified line

Improvements:
- Introduce a new command 'passwd' that can be used to change the current database's password.
- New passwords are asked twice for confirmation.
- add an alias for 'clist': 'cls'
- Introduce a new utility, which can (hopefully) convert pwsafe databases to kc XML databases.
- man page and documentation updates
- new feature to the 'new' and 'edit' commands:
  Now the escape sequences \r, \R, \a, \A can be used
  to request random characters in the value input. (sort
  of like \n to request a new line)
- New functional tests for detecting regressions.
- 'del' will ask for confirmation just like 'cdel'

Cosmetic changes:
- clean up unused variables
- sort the commands (quasi) by their names
