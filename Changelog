2.3.0:

Bug fixes:
- Plug in some memory leaks.
- Don't link to libssl, just libcrypto
- Information and error message corrections.
- With command 'cnew', force checking for the keychain's name instead of its
  index number while checking for an existing keychain.
- Change editline TAB completion, so that partial commands will be completed up
  until the first differing character in the matched command names.
- Fix potential crashes when importing bogus encrypted/plaintext databases.

Improvements:
- New command 'status':
	What database file is in use,
	and other funny stuff about the current database.
- New command 'info':
	Displays information about a key (currently only
	'created' and 'modified' properties).
- Make it possible to compile kc with libedit on Linux too, with the EDITLINE
  flag. The default remains readline on Linux.
- New feature for the 'export' command:
  xport <filename> [keychain]
  Export only one keychain from the current database to the specified file.
- xport command now exports to an encrypted kc database. Password will be
  prompted for.
- New 'dump' command to dump the whole XML structure to a plain text XML file.
  This is how 'xport' worked before.
- New 'plist' and 'pls' commands, to use a "pager" when listing more than 20
  keys in a keychain.
- Change database save logic so it tries hard not to end up with an unusable
  database file in case of a library or other catastrophic failure.
  Write to temporary file first, and if that succeeds, rename that file to the
  original database filename.
- Make the exported file readable only by its owner.
- New command 'append':
  append <filename>
  Append every keychain from 'filename' to the database. (ie.: without
  overwriting it like 'import')
  Append won't create existing keychains (based on their names), instead
  append their entries to the already present keychain.
- New commands 'appendxml' and 'importxml':
  In regards to xport/dump changes, make it possible to import/append encrypted
  database exports, and also xml database dumps.
- Add a DTD for the kc XML structure.
- Validate against the DTD when importing/appending.
- Use .kcd extension for kc encrypted database files. kc will be looking for
  'default.kcd' under ~/.kc, so rename you existing database if you used this
  name.
- New cc, ccdel, ccren commands. With these commands the keychain's name takes
  priority over its index number when specifying it as a parameter.

Cosmetic changes:
- Add PCRE information to version.
