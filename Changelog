2.4.0:

Bug fixes:
- Fix logic flaw in saving the new database file. There was no file lock on
  the newly saved database file after invoking the 'write' command.

Functional changes, improvements:
- Introduce new hotkeys while in value displaying, for copying 'values'
  to various clipboards:

  'x' will copy to PRIMARY X selection,
  'X' will copy to CLIPBOARD ("^C -> ^V") X selection,
  't' will insert the value to tmux's paste buffer.

  'x' and 'X' uses xclip(1): the 'value' is sent to its stdin.
  't' uses the tmux binary of course, and it just calls the set-buffer
      command with the 'value' as its parameter.

  Both binaries must be in PATH, and if they can not be executed, an error
  message gets printed.

  Removal of the 'values' from the clipboards are not being dealt with (!!!),
  it should be the user's responsibility.
