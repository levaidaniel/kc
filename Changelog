2.3.0:

Bug fixes:
- Plug in some memory leaks.
- Don't link to libssl, just libcrypto
- Information and error message corrections.
- With command 'cnew', force checking for the keychain's name instead of its
  index number while checking for an existing keychain.
- Change editline TAB completion, so that partial commands will be completed up
  until the first differing character in the matched command names.
- Fix potential crashes when importing bogus encrypted/plaintext databases.
- Avoid annoying situation, where one would enter EOT in the CLI with a dirty
  database, and during the confirmation - if the database should be saved or
  not - comes another EOT and kc would quit (without saving) regardless of the
  answer for the save confirmation question. Now kc will jump back to the CLI
  on an EOT during the saving confirmation question.

Functional changes, improvements:
- New commands
  status:
	What database file is in use,
	and other funny stuff about the current database.
  info:
	Displays information about a key (currently only
	'created' and 'modified' properties).
  append:
	append <filename>
	Append every keychain from 'filename' to the database. (ie.: without
	overwriting it like 'import')
	Append won't create existing keychains (based on their names), instead
	appends their entries to the already present keychain.
  importxml, appendxml:
	These commands work with plain text kc XML document dumps, in contrast
	to import/append which work with encrypted database exports (made by
	the xport command).
  dump:
  	Dump the whole XML structure to a plain text XML file.
	This is how 'xport' worked before.
  cc, ccdel, ccren commands:
	With these commands the keychain's name takes priority over its
	index number when specifying it as a parameter.
	This avoids confusion when naming a keychain as a number.
- xport command now exports to an encrypted kc database. Password will be
  prompted for.
  Also a new feature for the 'xport' and 'dump' commands:
  xport <filename> [keychain]
  dump <filename> [keychain]
  Export only one keychain from the current database to the specified file.
- import command now imports encrypted kc databases instead of plain XML dumps
  like before.
- Make the exported/dumped file readable only by its owner.
- Make it possible to compile kc with libedit on Linux too, with the EDITLINE
  flag. The default remains readline on Linux.
- Change database save logic so it tries hard not to end up with an unusable
  database file in case of a library or other catastrophic failure.
  Write to a temporary file first, and if that succeeds, rename that file to the
  original database filename.
- Add a DTD for the kc XML structure, and validate against it when
  importing/appending.
- Use .kcd extension for kc encrypted database files. kc will be looking for
  'default.kcd' under ~/.kc, so rename you existing database if you used this
  name.
- '[c]search' and '[c]/' commands now understand modifiers:
  An exclamation mark ('!') will negate (inverse) the matching and display
  non-matching key names.
  Character 'i' will ignore the case of characters during the search.
  The '*' characters remains the same, it search in every keychain.
  Also, it is now possible to include spaces in the patterns for both
  '[c]search' and '[c]/'.
- '/' and 'c/' commands' parameters (patterns) are now read after a space,
  like with every other command.
- Dropped 's' command. It was an alias for 'search'.
- 'list' command now uses a "pager" argument instead of keychain. It displays
  "pager" number of keys at once (the default is 20).
- CLI tab completion is a bit more user friendly.

Cosmetic changes:
- Add PCRE information to version.
- Renamed pwsafe convert script.
- Display the number of matches when using 'search' or '/' (with more than 5
  matches).
- Display the newly added key's index number after using the 'new' command.
