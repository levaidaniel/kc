2.4.0:
The new encrypted database format is incompatible with older versions!
However, the XML format has not been changed, so a dump/importxml is
adequate, to use the new program version:

This example presumes that the default database filename is being used.
Substitute the filename if necessary!

========================= 8< =========================

=> Execute the old kc (< v2.4), and dump the database to an XML file before
   upgrading
$ kc -k ~/.kc/default.kcd
Password:
<example_chain% > dump kcdump
Dump OK
<example_chain% > quit
$ ls kcdump.xml
kcdump.xml

=> Backup(!) (and move away) the old database file
$ mv ~/.kc/default.kcd ~/.kc/default.kcd-backup

=> Upgrade kc to v2.4
[However you handle this: from source, packages etc...]

=> Execute the new kc (>= v2.4) and create a new, empty database file, then
   import the previously dumped XML file.
$ kc
Creating '/home/user/.kc/default.kcd'
Using '/home/user/.kc/default.kcd' database.
New password (empty to cancel):
New password again (empty to cancel):
<default% > importxml kcdump.xml
Import OK
<example_chain% > write
Save OK
<example_chain% > quit

$ shred --remove kcdump.xml   [or equivalent, eg.: rm(1) -P]

Bug fixes:

Functional changes, improvements:
- Introduce new hotkeys while in value displaying, for copying 'values'
  to various clipboards:

  'x' will copy to PRIMARY X selection,
  'X' will copy to CLIPBOARD ("^C -> ^V") X selection,
  't' will insert the value to tmux's paste buffer.

  'x' and 'X' uses xclip(1): the 'value' is sent to its stdin.
  't' uses the tmux binary of course, and it just calls the set-buffer
      command with the 'value' as its parameter.

  Both binaries must be in PATH, and if they can not be executed, an error
  message gets printed.

  Removal of the 'values' from the clipboards are not being dealt with (!!!),
  it should be the user's responsibility.
