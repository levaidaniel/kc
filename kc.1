.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a console based username and password management application using an encrypted XML document as its database.
The database file is encrypted with a key that is generated from a user-supplied password and/or a security key and/or an SSH agent. Database encryption (and thus decryption) can be made interactive or non-interactive in that it could require user input (i.e. a password) or a response for a challenge from a security key, or a signature from an SSH agent. See the
.Em PASSWORDS
section on how to even combine all (or some) of these.
.Pp
A database file can contain multiple keychains, and keychains in turn can contain multiple keys (usernames if you like) and values (passwords if you like).
.Pp
After starting
.Nm
the
.Ic help
command shows the available commands, and usage information for them.
If you're in a hurry, for starters, you create a new entry with the
.Ic new
command and save it with
.Ic write .
You can see the stored keys with the
.Ic list
command, then entering only a number in the command line will display the entry with the given index.
You quit from the value display with
.Ql q
or EOT (usually CTRL+d).
.Pp
The CLI supports tab-completion for commands and keychains.
.Pp
When saving the database
.Po Ic write
command
.Pc
.Nm
will create a temporary file (under the same directory as the opened database file), and will first try to save the whole database to that temporary database file.
When this succeeds, only then will
.Nm
replace the old database with the new one, so you will always have a usable and intact (but potentially older) version of your database file.
.Ss PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It Fl k Ar file
Use
.Ar file
as database.
The default is
.Pa ~/.kc/default.kcd .
.It Fl c Ar keychain
Change to the specified keychain after opening the database.
.It Fl C Ar keychain
Same as
.Fl c ,
but force
.Ar keychain
to be the keychain's name, instead of its index number.
More on this is in the
.Ic c
and
.Ic cc
commands' description.
.It Fl r
Open the database in read-only mode.
.Nm
will not try to lock the database file, and commands which could modify the database will not be available.
.It Fl A Ar key-type,key-comment Op ,password
Use a signature from SSH agent as the database password.
For this,
.Nm
asks
.Xr ssh-agent 1
(using the
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
environment variable) to sign the IV and the salt of the database (and optionally a password) with a private key loaded into
.Xr ssh-agent 1 .
This private key is looked up based on the
.Ar key type
and
.Ar key comment
separated by a comma (with no whitespaces around it).
.Pp
Key types supported and tested so far are RSA and ED25519, by using the type names
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It Ar ssh-rsa
.It Ar ssh-ed25519
.El
.Pp
respectively.
Due to the nature of *DSA keys,
.Nm
cannot use them in this specific way for this specific purpose.
.Pp
Key comments cannot contain comma (,) characters.
.Pp
If the word
.Ql password
is appended to the key comment after a comma (with no whitespaces around it), then
.Nm
will also use the password (along with the IV and salt) as the input for the SSH agent signature request. Thus making it interactive (by requesting a password for decryption) instead of an automatic database opening.
.Pp
E.g.:
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It Ar ssh-ed25519,daniel-private,password
Search for an
.Ql ed25519
type key with a comment
.Ql daniel-private
and also ask for a password to use when opening the database.
.El
.Pp
Also worth mentioning that this actually works with agent forwarding as well, so on a remote machine one doesn't even have to have the actual private key file -- just like in any other case when you'd use SSH agent forwarding.
.It Fl y Ar Key-slotDevice-index Op ,password
Use a YubiKey to utilize its challenge-response mechanism to construct the password for the database. This can be either an automatic or an interactive mode of operation (just like with SSH agent support). Without the
.Ql password
parameter the challenge will be the database salt value, thus facilitating an automatic database open.
.Pp
There is actually only one argument to this option, and that is a two digit number plus optionally the word
.Ql password
after a comma (with no whitespaces around it).
.Pp
The first digit is the YubiKey slot and the second digit is the device index number. E.g.:
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It Ar 10
means slot 1 and device 0 (the first device).
.It Ar 20
means slot 2 and device 0 (the first device).
.It Ar 21
means slot 2 and device 1 (the second device) etc...
.El
.Pp
It's not necessary to specify the second digit --
.Nm
will use the device index 0 by default, so it's sufficient to provide only one digit, i.e. the key slot.
.Pp
If the word
.Ql password
is appended to the parameter with a comma (,), then the user-supplied password is used as the challenge with the security key -- otherwise the database's salt is the challenge (stored in the database). When using this option, the password can be at most 64 bytes long. E.g.:
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It Ar 20,password
Use the frist device, the second slot, and ask for a password to use as the challenge.
.El
.It Fl p Ar file
Read password from
.Ar file .
The last new line gets stripped.
.It Fl P Ar kdf
KDF to use with the password.
Valid parameters are:
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It Ar sha3
OpenSSL's PKCS5 PBKDF2 with SHA-3 512.
.It Ar sha512
OpenSSL's PKCS5 PBKDF2 with SHA-2 512.
This is the default.
.It Ar bcrypt
Bcrypt PBKDF based on Blowfish. This is slower than the SHA-* or scrypt variants.
On Linux, a bundled bcrypt implementation from
.Ox
is used, and its version is the one that was available at the time of this
.Nm
release.
.It Ar scrypt
If compiled with libscrypt,
.Nm
can use the scrypt KDF.
The speed of this is somewhere between SHA-* and bcrypt. The
.Fl R
option is ignored when using this.
.El
.Pp
More information is in the
.Em KDF
section.
.It Fl R Ar iterations
Number of iterations or rounds to use with the KDF.
.Pp
More information is in the
.Em KDF

.It Ic write
Save the database.
.It Ic save
Alias of
.Ic write .
.It Ic any number
To display a key's value, you enter the key's index (ie.: only a number) into the command line, then it will display the entry with the given index.
You quit from the display with 'q' or EOT (usually CTRL+d).
By specifying another number after the index (eg.: '12 2' -- here 12 is the index, and 2 is the extra number (spice) after it), that many random characters will be displayed between the value's characters.
You can navigate up/down through a multiline value's lines with keys j/k, n/p, f/b, +/-, [/], {/}, </>, <SPACE>, <ENTER>, <BACKSPACE>.
Typing a number between 1-9 will jump directly to that line.
.Pp
It is possible to copy the displayed value to a clipboard (or such) with these hotkeys:
.Bl -tag -offset ||| -width |
.It t
Copy the value to the tmux paste buffer like the
.Ic tmux
command.
.It x
Copy the value to the PRIMARY X selection.
like the
.Ic xclip
command.
.It X
Copy the value to the CLIPBOARD X selection, like the
.Ic Xclip
command.
.El
.Pp
Check the
.Em CAVEATS
section about the clipboard commands.
.Pp
Perhaps the extra number (spice) after a key's index and its usefulness can use some further explanation.
Let's say you want to display a password to use it on a website's form, but you don't want the people walking by or around you to recognize words, numbers or parts of it.
You can use this nifty "trick" to tell
.Nm
to display that many random characters between the value's original characters when showing it to you.
Granted, it will look like a mess (although, that is what we wanted), but you can copy-paste it to the password entry in the website form in question.
Then you can start to "blindly" delete the given number of characters from it by moving you cursor to the beginning (eg.: HOME key), pressing 'spice' numbers of DEL, then jump over one character to the right (with the right arrow key), then delete the random characters again, then repeating this until you reach the end of you original password (those who played Mortal Kombat will feel a bit nostalgic).
You can catch on to this, because the random character padding is of fixed length, so the pattern remains the same for the whole password.
You don't even have to pay attention to the original length of the password, because after you've completed the pattern (DELs-move-DELs-move...) and removed the spice (ie.: every padding random character), you end up with you original password, and you'll just be deleting nothing after the end of the string.
This of course only makes sense if the form is a password input field, so you (and everybody else) just see stars or dots in place of the password.

.Ss CIPHERS
Databases are encrypted with the AES-256 cipher in CBC mode, if another cipher and mode was not specified explicitly
.Po see the
.Fl e
and
.Fl m
options
.Pc . Ciphers use a key generated with a KDF from the user-supplied password (and optionally a signature from an SSH agent or a HMAC response from a YubiKey), and an IV (initialization vector) that is read when first creating a database from the host's specific random device
.Po Pa /dev/urandom
on Linux and
.Pa /dev/random
on everything else
.Pc .
.Pp
To change the encryption cipher and/or its mode, you can use the
.Ic passwd
or
.Ic export
command.
.Pp
See also the
.Em CAVEATS
section.
.Ss KDF
The KDF
.Po key derivation function
.Pc converts the constructed password (either directly from the user input or after being treated with one of the relevant functions like an SSH agent or a security key) with a generated salt to a strong key that can be used safely during encryption.
.Pp
Every SHA-* based PBKDF2 function uses 100000 iterations and the bcrypt KDF uses 36 rounds by default. If you're using
.Nm
on an old enough (quite old) hardware, you might reckon that these numbers are too high, or in other words, opening a database takes too much time. See option
.Fl R
if you really think you should change this. And remember, after saving/exporting a database with a certain number of KDF rounds or iterations, you must use the same number when trying to open it.
.Pp
On changing the KDF being used, see the
.Ic passwd
command and the
.Fl P
option.
.Ss PASSWORDS
Although
.Nm
uses a key generated with a KDF to encrypt
.Po and decrypt
.Pc
a database, one of the inputs of that is usually
.Po but not necessarily
.Pc
a user-supplied password. There are currently a couple of options to consider when deciding how to create and/or use a database.
.Bl -tag -width |
.It A single password
Most simple one
.Po doesn't need any specific parameter to be specified
.Pc , just type in a password when creating a database and use the same one when opening it. Old school.
.It A signature based on an SSH key loaded into an SSH agent
This method -- when used with the
.Ar -A
option -- takes the database IV and salt
.Po both available when reading the database file
.Pc
and the SSH agent generates a
.Ql new password
from them. This will be the kind of gibberish that's essentially harder to guess than your average password, but takes data as input that's available directly from the database file. Thus, when someone has read access to the database file *and* the SSH agent that has the required key loaded (or the private key directly), they can open the database. This method is convenient because one doesn't have to input a password
.Po the database open is non-interactive
.Pc
so it works neatly when combined with other tools -- I've used this e.g. with
.Xr mutt 1
to get my IMAP/SMTP password without having to type in anything when I started it.
.Pp
Additionally one can use a user-supplied password on top all of this
.Po by supplying the 
.Ar ,password
parameter
.Pc , that will be mixed in with the input when getting the signature from the SSH agent. Thus adding an interactive layer to the database opening, and making it harder for someone to open the database if they steal it along with the required SSH private key.
.Pp
What
.Nm
actually does is not only mixing in the password when getting the signature, but also directly appending it to the signature when using it as input with the KDF. In this case, when opening the database
.Nm
will ask for a password and the SSH agent for a signature based on the correct private key.
.It A challenge-response from a security key
.Nm
supports the YubiKey's HMAC challenge-response mode
.Po using the
.Ar -y
option
.Pc
and the response is used as the password input for the KDF. This too can have an added conveniency of not having to type in anything when opening the database, because
.Nm
can use only the database salt as the challenge, and so the response from the security key will be based on this. The salt is directly available from the database file, so if someone steals it *and* the required security key, they can open the database.
.Pp
There is however the 
.Ar ,password
parameter here as well, with which one can add an interactive layer on top all of this, and use the user-supplied password (combined with the salt if it's not long enough) as the challenge. In this case, when opening the database
.Nm
will ask for a password and the correct security key.
.It Combining authentication features
Now, knowing that database passwords can be generated with the help of an SSH agent and a YubiKey security key with a user-supplied password, another thing one can do besides using either one of the above functions, is to combine all of these. If -- and only if -- SSH agent signing and security key challenge-response are used with a password
.Po see
.Ar ,password
parameter for both of these
.Pc
then
.Nm
will treat the user-supplied password first with the SSH agent and then subsequently with the security key, thus requiring the user's password, the SSH private key and the security key to open the database later on. This may sound convoluted, and I'm not even sure if it's worth the
.Qq trouble ,
nevertheless, it is a possibility and I think it shows how the separate features are built up.
.El
.Pp
At the end of the day, all these functions do is provide a password to be used with the KDF to generate a key from it. Choose one that you deem secure enough, is convenient and works for you.
.Ss LIMITS
.Nm
has its limits when it comes to dealing with keychains and keys in keychains.
The maximum number of elements for both is the upper limit an unsigned long integer can store on the running platform, minus one.
These limits are enforced every time a new keychain or key is being created (or moved, copied, etc...).
Appending is done in a non-atomic fashion.
This means that
.Nm
will not create a keychain if it would not fit in the limit, and it will not append keys to an existing keychain if they would not fit in the limit.
However, for example, if a database that is being appended contains a keychain whose keys could not fit in the existing keychain, and also contains a keychain whose keys could fit in the existing keychain, then the one that could fit will be appended, and the one that could not will not be appended.
This means that appending is atomic on the keychain level (or keys level, if you like), and not atomic on the database level.

Fair warnings before using the clipboard features:
.Bl -enum -offset ||| -width |
.It
If you don't trust the system where you're running
.Ic kc
then don't use these features, as you can not be sure that the binaries in your PATH are not tampered with and would record the passwords.

Removal of the
.Em values
from the clipboards are not being dealt with.
This should be the user's responsibility.

SSH agent support:
.Bl -enum -offset ||| -width |
.It
The password (signature) coming from
.Xr ssh-agent 1
varies between different types of SSH keys -- different keys/key bit lengths produce different signature lengths.
.It
.Nm
cannot handle spaces in the key comment when using the
.Ic export
or
.Ic import
commands.
Opening a database however, works with spaces in the key comment.

YubiKey HMAC challenge-response:
.Bl -enum -offset ||| -width |
.It
Supports an at most 64 bytes long password.
.It
Only HMAC mode is supported by
.Nm
.It
Maybe it goes without saying, but this method of password protection is not quite useful over network connections (e.g.: SSH on a remote machine), as the actual device is not plugged in there. There is, however, a USB-over-IP implementation for Linux that could overcome this.

.Pp
Miscellaneous:
.Bl -enum -offset ||| -width |
.It
It is considered a good practice, to periodically manually backup the database file(s) you use with
.Nm .
This could just mean a simple:
.Bd -literal -offset |||
$ cp ~/.kc/default ~/.kc/default-bkp
.Ed
.It
.Nm
doesn't try excessively hard to recover from hard and/or non-recoverable errors (OS, memory, disk etc...), and in some cases this could mean that it will simply exit (without saving the database) with an appropriate error message.
No need to worry, but keep this in mind like you would with a common word processor or text editor and save periodically, for example when you edit many keys at once.
.It
There is no character set conversion taking place in the program. In this case this means you must be ready to display anything you type in. If somehow you still end up with texts you can not display properly, and for whatever reason you can not edit them in
.Nm ,
you can
.Qq repair
such database by dumping its content to a
.Nm
XML file
.Po see the
.Ic dump
command
.Pc , converting the plain text XML file to a working character set, then importing back that XML file
.Po see the
.Ic importxml
command
.Pc .
.It
If you use
.Ar cfb128
or
.Ar ofb
as the cipher mode, there is no specific sign if you enter a wrong password during the opening of a database; in this case the database will seem to be corrupt after decrypting, and
.Nm
simply will not be able to open it.
.It
There is a Perl script in the source package (available from the project website) that converts an exported pwsafe database to a
.Nm
compatible XML database, which can be imported using the
.Ic importxml
command.
.Em NOTA BENE:
This script is really old and not maintained.
