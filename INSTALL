Prerequisites:
- libbsd >= 0.2.0 (except on BSDs, of course)
- libxml >= 2.6
- libedit or libreadline
- openssl >= 1.0.0

Optional:
- libpcre >= 8.12
- libscrypt >= 1.14


Compile:

- BSD:
  $ make <OPTIONS>
  $ make install

- Linux:
  $ gmake -f Makefile.linux <OPTIONS>
  $ gmake -f Makefile.linux install

Options:
HAVE_PCRE=y		This will turn on regexp support in searches, and needs libcpre.
HAVE_LIBSCRYPT=y	This will turn on scrypt KDF support.
BUNDLED_BCRYPT=y	To use the packaged bcrypt implementation (that comes
			from OpenBSD). Basically, this must be used everywhere
			but on OpenBSD.
OS_OPENBSD=y		Only in Makefile, and currently this only makes the
			binary link against OpenBSD's libutil (to use the
			bcrypt_pbkdf() function).

EDITLINE=y	Use libedit as the line editing function. This needs libedit.
READLINE=y	Use readline as the line editing function. This needs libreadline.

		Makefile.linux uses Readline and Makefile uses Editline by default.

Linux example:
  $ gmake -f Makefile.linux HAVE_PCRE=1 BUNDLED_BCRYPT=yes HAVE_LIBSCRYPT=1 && gmake -f Makefile.linux install

OpenBSD example:
  $ make HAVE_PCRE=yes OS_OPENBSD=1 && make install

FreeBSD example:
  $ make HAVE_PCRE=yes HAVE_LIBSCRYPT=1 BUNDLED_BCRYPT=y && make install
