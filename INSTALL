Prerequisites:
- libbsd >= 0.2.0 (except on BSDs, of course)
- libxml >= 2.6
- libedit or libreadline

Optional:
- libpcre >= 8.12


Compile:

- BSD:
  $ make <OPTIONS>
  $ make install

- Linux:
  $ gmake -f GNUMakefile <OPTIONS>
  $ gmake -f GNUMakefile install

Options:
HAVE_PCRE=y	This will turn on regexp support in searches, and needs libcpre.

EDITLINE=y	Use libedit as the line editing function. This needs libedit.
READLINE=y	Use readline as the line editing function. This needs libreadline.

		GNUMakefile uses Readline and Makefile uses Editline by default.

Example:
  $ make HAVE_PCRE=1 && make install
or
  $ gmake -f GNUMakefile HAVE_PCRE=1 EDITLINE=1 && gmake -f GNUMakefile install
